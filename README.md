multiple device screens.
3. App should have an intuitive UI that can be operated by
novice expert Internet users.
------------------------------
After All the above Tasks following tasks are followed
=
1. Complete all the endpoints for CRUD operations on Muzix
2. Use h2-console to view in-memory data
3. Add an endpoint to search trackByName. Understand @Query and parameter passing to
@Query
4. Generate API documentation using Swagger 2

5. Create custom exceptions TrackNotFoundException, TrackAlreadyExistsException in a
com.stack....exceptions package. Perform appropriate exception handling and propagation
back.
6. Running Logic on Startup in Spring. Create seed data to pre-fill the database with movie
information whenever the application starts. Use both approaches:
Approach 1: ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>
Approach 2: CommandLineRunner (Find out how it differs from ApplicationRunner)

7.Global exception using Controller advice
8. Remove all hardcoded data from the application code to application.properties
a) by using @Value.
b) by using @PropertySource
c) by using Environment
d) by using @ConfigurationProperties
(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/
Environment.html)
9. Add @Lombok
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQpEQZbDD9pmW2qrhYsx5N9XYQ5bJ5dM/view)
10. Create another service implementation TrackDummyServiceImpl. Use @Primary and
@Qualifier annotations to specify which implementation to use.
11. Use @Profile to run the application with the existing service implementation, and the new
TrackDummyServiceImpl implementation.

12. Swap in-memory H2 database with MySQL.
13. Create two additional properties file application-dev.properties that contains configuration for
H2 and application-prod.properties that contains configurations for MySQL.
